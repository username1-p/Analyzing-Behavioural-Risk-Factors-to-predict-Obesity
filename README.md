# Analyzing-Behavioural-Risk-Factors-to-predict-Obesity

This repo contains code for my GLM which was used to predict whether an individual is obese based on behaviourial factors. It was created by Prinsa Gandhi. The purpose is to create a report which will summarize the results of my generalized linear model. I have listed steps below to obtain the data I have used. The sections of this repo are DataCleaning, DataAnalysis, and outputs. The cleaning and analysis sections include Rstudio scripts, and the output file includes an Rmarkdown file and the final report. The input section is not included in this repo as it is the data I used, however, I have included steps to obtain the data.

Inputs contain data that are unchanged from their original. I used one dataset, which is the 2013 BRFSS survey. 

This dataset is obtained from kaggle, which is a bit more of a cleaned version, compared to the original data. 

The kaggle data which is the 2013 BRFSS Data:

LPLenka. 2020, November. BRFSS Data. The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) 2013. Version 3. Retrieved December 2020 from  https://www.kaggle.com/lplenka/brfss-data.  

The data above is cleaned from the original dataset. 

The original dataset is avaliable at:

“CDC - BRFSS 2013 Survey Data and Documentation. 2013 BRFSS Overview. .” Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System , 23 July 2013, www.cdc.gov/brfss/annual_data/annual_2013.html.

My output files contains my report work and additional material that support my report.

It contains the report.Rmd file, as well as a pdf document. 

The script files includes R scripts that I used to do important coding work before I moved onto the report. It contains methods I used to clean the data, as well as model the data. It contains scripts that produces outputs. The DataAnalysis folder contains an analysis.R and modelling1.R file. The DataCleaning file contains a datacleaning.R file.
